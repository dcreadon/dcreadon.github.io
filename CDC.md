# 🛡️ Cyber Defense Competition (Hosted by Iowa State)

## 📝 Project Description
For this competition, I was on the defensive (Blue Team) side and my team was tasked with securing various servers against an impending team of hackers known as the Red Team. The attackers attempted to gain access to our resources, steal flags, and disrupt services throughout the duration of the competition.

A critical component of this competition was writing Intrusion Reports. These reports required us to outline exactly how an attacker gained access to the system and document their post-exploitation activities. Additionally, we solved riddles and technical challenges (called "Anomalies") to gain extra points. This competition provided high-pressure, real-world experience in security operations and significantly propelled my understanding of defensive concepts.

## 🛠️ My Role
My primary focus during the competition was **Incident Response and Forensics**.

* **Log Analysis:** My main responsibility was to sift through system logs immediately after a flag was stolen. I identified the timestamps of the intrusion and traced the attacker's activity.
* **Reporting:** Once the attack vector was identified, I captured evidence (screenshots/logs) and authored the official Intrusion Report to recover points.
* **Anomalies:** I also worked on solving technical challenges, which required researching specific vulnerabilities and encryption methods to earn bonus points for the team.

## 🧠 Skills or Knowledge Gained
* **🐧 Ubuntu/Linux Forensics**: I gained practical experience using the Linux CLI to analyze system logs (e.g., `auth.log`, `syslog`) to identify suspicious connections and file modifications during active attacks.
* **Windows Event Viewer**: I learned to navigate the Windows Event Viewer efficiently to locate specific Event IDs related to login failures, privilege escalation, and service manipulation.
* **RDP & Networking**: Worked extensively with the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and port forwarding configurations to ensure legitimate administrative access was maintained while blocking malicious traffic.
