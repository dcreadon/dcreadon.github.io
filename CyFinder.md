![Front/Backend Image](/images/frontend-backend.png)

## Description of Project
This project was undertaken during the fall semester of my junior year while taking the COM S 3090 class. This class was specifically a group project class, meaning that the entire semester we worked on this project. For this project, I was assigned to a team with three other people and our sole task was to make a fully functional app by the end of the semester. The type of app we chose to build was one where users could leave reviews on apartments and view the reviews of other users before deciding to sign a lease. Throughout the semester, myself and my group were hard at work on this app until we could build a finished product.

## My Role
Within this team, there were two roles somebody could be assigned: frontend, or backend. Frontend is the development of the UI and what the user of the app sees, while backend is the development of data bases and storing the information. For this project, I was on the frontend team. My biggest role on this team was to develop the UI for the app and any additional APIs that we may require in the interface. Additionally, I would go through and fix the formatting to ensure that everything was looking good. Overall, my role was not limited to just one, but many that were required to copmlete this project.

## Skills or Knowledge Gained
***Android Studio***: This is the main platform that was used for development during the project. It is a software that allows developers to easily develop webpages and is in Javascript so I was able to gain valuable experience with that as well.
***Git***: This was the main platform used to consolidate all of our files for the project. I was able to push and pull all of the code necessary from from the github using a git terminal. Addiontally, I was able to save all of my code directly from a terminal without having to navigate to github. This Application was very helpful when dealing with large amounts of files.
***Team Communication Skills***: Throughout this project I had to ensure that my communication with the team was always hasty. It was very easy for things to break in the project, so I had to always be ready to respond and help if anything ever went wrong.
