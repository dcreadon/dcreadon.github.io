## 📝 Description of Project
This project was undertaken during the fall semester of my junior year while taking the **COM S 3090** class. This was a dedicated group project course where we spent the entire semester building a single comprehensive system. 

For this project, I was assigned to a team of four, and our task was to build a fully functional application by the end of the term. We chose to build an **Apartment Finder App** where users could leave reviews on apartments and view the reviews of others before signing a lease. Throughout the semester, my group and I worked iteratively to take this from concept to a finished product.

## 🛠️ My Role
Within this team, roles were divided into Frontend (UI/User Experience) and Backend (Database/Server). 

I was assigned to the Frontend Team. My primary responsibility was developing the **User Interface (UI)** for the Android application and integrating the APIs required to fetch data from the backend. Additionally, I handled the layout formatting to ensure a consistent and polished look across all screens. Overall, my role was multifaceted, requiring me to jump in wherever necessary to complete the project.

## 🧠 Skills or Knowledge Gained
* **Android Studio (Java/XML)**: This was the main platform used for development. It allowed me to build native mobile interfaces. I gained valuable experience in **Java** for logic and **XML** for layout design, as well as managing the Android Activity lifecycle.
* **Git & GitHub**: Git was the primary tool used for version control. I learned to manage branches, merge code, and perform push/pull operations via the command line. This workflow was essential for consolidating code from multiple team members and resolving conflicts in a large codebase.
* **Team Communication**: Throughout this project, I ensured my communication with the team was always **timely and clear**. Because different components of the app relied on each other, I had to be ready to troubleshoot and collaborate immediately if a merge broke functionality or if the backend API changed.
