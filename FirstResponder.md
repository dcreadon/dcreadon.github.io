## Project Description
For this project, I was tasked with building a simulated first responder drone in c. This dron would be capable of navigating an obstacle course like the one above. This drone, which is really a roomba, utilized an IR sensor to navigate around the obstacle course. The main goal of the project was to create a Graphical User Interface in python for someone to be able to navigate the drone. They could press buttons such as: up, down, left, right, and naviagate around the obstacle course based on the readings from the IR Sensor. Towards the end, the drone became fully autonomous and did not require any human intervention. 

## My Role
For this project, within my team, I was not necessarily assigned to a specific role but rather did a little bit of everything to help complete the project. To start, I worked on the base functionality of the drone in c. I would write many functions and tests to ensure that the code was working as expected. Additionally, I worked with the IR sensors extensively. I was tasked with making sure the sensor data was properly integrated into the code. Lastly, I helped build the GUI that would control the robot. Overall, I had many roles within this team and helped anywhere I could. 

## Skills or Knowledge Gained
- ***C***: Throughout the course of this project, I coded extensively in the c language. I was able to learn about the structure of c and how it operates compared to other languages like python.
- ***Python***: When working on the GUI of this drone, I was able to gain valuable experience in the Python programming language.
- ***IR Sensors***: Worked on calibrating the IR Sensor and gained extensive knowledge in how to integrate sensors into C code.
