### Project

- Trusted Indicator Puller
  - The main project I worked on over the summer dealt with gathering trusted IPs and pushing them to the firewalls.
  - The first step of the project was to make HTTP requests to differnt URLs hosting trusted CIDR ranges.
  - This step was implemented completely in python and could run straight from vs code.
  - The second step of the project, was to make a feed integration within Cortex XSIAM.
  - This feed integration was able to take the list of these IP addresses and publish them onto an External Dynamic List.
  - This external dynamic list was hosted on a URL that the firewalls were able to reference.
  - The third step was to create a function that was able to check the old list of IP addresses against the new incoming list.
  - This allowed for visibility on seeing which IP addresses were removed or added from the list.
  - The final step, was to configure the firewalls.
  - To do this, I just had to input the external dynamic list URL into the firewall interface. 
  - Once the firewall was configured, each component began working together to keep the firewall open for trusted IP addresses.
